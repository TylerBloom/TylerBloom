## Education
### Undergraduate
I graduated with my BS in both Math and Physics from Fort Hays State University in Dec. of 2019.
A large emphasis was placed in computational physics and modeling during my undergrad education, which was my gateway into the wider world of developement.

### Graduate
I am currently a graduate student at the University of Vermont working on my MS in Math.
The focus of my Masters is on pure (versus applied) math with a concentration in combinatorics, particularly graph theory.

## Languages
### Avid Rustacean
I have enjoyed no language more than Rust.
The language is great, but the ecosystem around it makes it unbeatable.

### C++ Appreciator
While Rust has largely replaced C++ in my life, I still respect and admire it.

### Begrudging Pythonier
Python is great for quick problems and scripts but nothing too substantial.
Developement speed is rarely worth the headaches small typos can cause.
