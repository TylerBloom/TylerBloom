## Education
### Undergraduate
I graduated with my BS in both math and physics from Fort Hays State University in Dec. of 2019.
A large emphasis was placed in computational physics and modeling during my undergrad education, which was my gateway into the wider world of software engineering.

### Graduate
I graduated with my MS in pure math from the University of Vermont with a concentration in combinatorics, particularly graph theory.

## Projects
I tend to work on whatever sounds interesting to me, but nearly everything I write is written in Rust.
Often, this leads me to full-stack Rust projects.

### My blog
I maintain a dev blog ([The Avid Rustacean](https://avid-rustacean.shuttleapp.rs/)) where I discuss my projects and write educational posts about how to reason about Rust from the ground up.
If you have a topic that you would like to see explored, open an issue on the blog's repo!

### Squire
Squire is tournament software for Magic: the Gathering tournaments.
Originally a Python service, it was the project that got me into Rust.

### Specter
My newest project is specter.
It is my attempt at an emulator ecosystem.
It is still in the early stages, but I have big plans for it, including making it playable across all platforms (including in the browser) and have a syncing service manage saves between devices.

I'm starting with a GameBoy color emulator but plan to build emulators for most of the major Nintendo handheld systems.
Once functional, I want to build a handheld of my own so that I can play it on the go.

## Professional work
Currently, I work Apollo GraphQL on this query planning team, putting my graph studies to good use.
